# Gravitational Lensing
Project(s) on gravitational lensing and photon deflection.

1) The first work is titled "Light-Like Trajectories About Neutral Gravitational Sources", completed as a requirement for the Physics Directed Reading Program at UC Berkeley, and is about photon deflection in the simplest case of uncharged masses with significant gravity.  _Note: I do not claim that this is completely original work.  It cites research of many who did this before, I only claim that the calculations were done independently, as thoroughly as they have been done in here._

Included in 1) are the Mathematica Notebooks, PDF of the paper, and bibTeX file of all the sources. (Note: The .nb file will look like nonsense unless you have Mathematica.  All the visualizations are in the PDF)
