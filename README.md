# Gravitational Lensing
Project(s) on gravitational lensing and photon deflection.

The first work is titled "Light-Like Trajectories About Neutral Gravitational Sources", completed as a requirement for the Physics Directed Reading Program at UC Berkeley, and is about photon deflection in the simplest case of uncharged masses with significant gravity.

# I claim no originality on it, it is a widely known example, I only did the calculations independently.
